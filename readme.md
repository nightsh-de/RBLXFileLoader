# Silly little thing that lets you use local files as scripts

Yeah so I dunno why I honestly made this, mainly out of boredom, maybe I can turn this into something later I guess.

This basically was made cause I felt like I needed to know whether its actually possible to upload local files as scripts or not. Apparently, yes you can. You need loadstring enabled, though, but considering Roblox is not letting you use nor `HttpService` nor `loadstring()` on client, this might not be as big of a problem.

If anyone finds a use to this, go wild with it or whatever, I quite honestly dont care lol. Maybe this can be turned into something cool, like a requirement to solve a secret in some game, or stupid- like a part of a backdoor or some other "virus" in a free model.

>Another note here, Might improve this whole thing overtime if I feel like it, just for some sillies or whatever. I'll probably look into more ways you can mess with Roblox using local server.


## Small edit here,
after doing tiniest bit of testing, you can just put scripts on literally anywhere, like github for example and it'd still work (and you wont need to set up a local server).
